    "Al ser modelos de ensemble su arquitectura permite corregir errores de manera iterativa, pasando correcciones a cada arbol de decisión interno que los compone. Cada uno de estos modelos tiene sus particularidades y sus bondades, pero se caracterizan por poder identificar relaciones más complejas que los modelos clásicos, además, de no requerir un preprocesamiento tan complejo en comparación con los modelos clásicos. Otra de sus bondades, es la capacidad de escalar en un datadet con gran cantidad de datos, puesto que algoritmos clásicos pueden quedarse cortos y no obtener desempeños esperados."
